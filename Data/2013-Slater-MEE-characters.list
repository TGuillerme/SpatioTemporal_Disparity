90. Last lower molar - hypoconulid - orientation and relative size (applicable to the taxa with at least a talonid heel; scored on the third molar for Peramus and eutherians, the fourth molar for Kielantherium and metatherians; justification for separating this character from the character of the anterior molar hypoconulids is that the ultimate molar shows different morphology and distribution, especially in taxa in which there is posteriorly decreasing size gradient, e.g. Deltatheridium): (0) Short and erect; (1) Tall (higher than hypoconid) and recurved.
91.

97. Presence vs. absence of the ectoflexus on the upper second molar (or postcanines in the middle portion of the postcanine row). Comments: justification for separating this character from the next is that only a single upper molar is known for three taxa that are otherwise crucial for assessing the timing and biogeography of the divergence of earliest-known crown therians: Murtoilestes, Atokatheridium, and Kokopellia. Nanolestes and Shuotherium are also only represented by isolated upper molars. Therefore, the gradient character of the ectoflexus along the tooth row is not applicable for these taxa. Presence vs. absence of the ectoflexus alone does not exhaust the systematic distribution of the ectoflexus-related characters among taxa with isolatedupper molars. (0) Absent or weakly developed; (1) Present.
98. Ectoflexus gradient along the molar series (see the above for justification of separatingpresence/absence from the gradient of the ectoflexus on the upper molar(s)): (0) Present on penultimate molar, but weakly developed or absent on the anterior molars;(1) Present on the penultimate and preceding molars.
