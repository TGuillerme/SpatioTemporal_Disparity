\opening{Dear Editors,}

The fact that mammals could only diversify after the extinction of the fierce and dominant mesozoic non-avian dinosaurs is a textbook example of faunal replacements and of the long term effect of the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction.
However, this example has been heavily debate in the last four years (Meredith et al 2011 Science; O'Leary et al 2013 Science; Springer et al 2013 Science; dos Reis et al 2014 Biology Letters) with mixed evidences supporting a diversification of mammals post-K-Pg (suggesting an effect of the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs) or pre-K-Pg (suggesting no effect of the extinction event).
A major part of this debates relies in different signal from different sources of data (palaeontological data \textit{vs.} neontological data) as well as the use of taxonomic diversity as a proxy for measuring mammalian diversification.

In this research article, entitled ``Mammalian morphological diversity does not increase in response to the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction and the extinction of the (non-avian) dinosaurs'', we propose a resolution of this debate by using both palaeontological and neontological data through the use of Total Evidence tip-dated phylogenies (from Slater 2013 Methods Ecol. Evol. and Beck \& Lee 2014 Proceedings Roy. Soc. B) as well as using morphological diversity (i.e. disparity) rather than taxonomic diversity to estimate morphological diversification.
To our knowledge, our article is the first to propose such an approach to the mammal diversification debate.

By using data from both living and fossil taxa and a disparity through time approach, we found no evidences for a direct effect of the K-Pg extinction event on mammalian diversification.
We therefore propose, contrary to popular belief, that the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs at the K-Pg boundary, 66 million years ago, was not the factor that allowed mammalians to diversify during the Tertiary.

We look forward to hearing from you soon,

\closing{Yours sincerely,}
