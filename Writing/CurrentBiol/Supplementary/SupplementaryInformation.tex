\section{Supplemental Data}

\subsection{Phylogenies}
This section (Figures S1 and S2) contains the trimmed phylogenies used in the analysis (see methods section in the main text for details).
Both trees contain few taxa compared to the overall species richness of living and fossil mammals \cite{bininda2007delayed,archibald2011extinction}.
This is because Total Evidence trees need a lot of data, particularly morphological data for living taxa that can be hard to locate \cite{GuillermeCooper}.
Therefore, most Total Evidence studies to date contain one or two orders of magnitude fewer taxa than phylogenies based solely on molecular data (e.g. thousands of taxa in \cite{bininda2007delayed,meredithimpacts2011} \textit{vs.} hundreds in \cite{ronquista2012,Slater2012MEE,beckancient2014}).

\subsection{Comparison of different disparity metrics and time sampling methods}
This section (Figure S6, S7, S8 and S9) contains the results of the variation of disparity through time analyses for Mammaliaformes and Eutheria using all the disparity metrics and methods for sampling disparity through time.
The different disparity metrics are the median distance from centroid (see main text for details), and the sum and products of ranges and variances of the cladisto-space dimensions.
The sum and products of ranges and variances are calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \text{Sum of ranges}=\sum{(max(\mathbf{v}_{n})-min(\mathbf{v}_{n}))}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \text{Sum of variances}=\sum{(\sigma^{2}(\mathbf{v}_{n}))}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \text{Product of ranges}=\prod{(max(\mathbf{v}_{n})-min(\mathbf{v}_{n}))}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \text{Product of variances}=\prod{(\sigma^{2}(\mathbf{v}_{n}))}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $\mathbf{v}_{n}$ is any of the $n$ eigenvectors (i.e. any of the $n$ dimensions of the cladisto-space), $max$ and $min$ are respectively the maximum and minimum values of each eigenvector $\mathbf{v}_{n}$, and $\sigma^{2}$ is the variance of each eigenvector $\mathbf{v}_{n}$. 

The different time sampling methods are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Intervals (tips only)}.
We selected every tip present at every geological stage (i.e. the smaller stratigraphic units) from the early Middle Jurassic (Bajocian, starting at 170.3 Ma) to the present.
We collapsed together every stage containing fewer than three tips so that every time interval contained at least three tips.
Note that some tips were present in multiple stages due to their occurrence data (see main text for details).
\item \textbf{Intervals (tips and nodes)}.
We selected tips and nodes present at every stage from the early Middle Jurassic (Bajocian, starting at 170.3 Ma) to the present.
We collapsed together every stage containing fewer than three elements (tips and/or nodes).
\item \textbf{Slices (punctuated)}.
These are the results presented in the main text where the cladisto-space is sampled every 5 Ma and the mode of evolution between each subsample is assumed to be punctuated (randomly selecting either data from the descendant or the ancestor when slicing through a branch; see main text for details).
\item \textbf{Slices (punctuated: ACCTRAN)}.
Similar to the slices (punctuated) method but data are always selected from the descendant (see main text for details).
\item \textbf{Slices (punctuated: DELTRAN)}.
Similar to the slices (punctuated) method but data are always selected from the ancestor (see main text for details).
\item \textbf{Slices (gradual)}.
These are the results presented in the main text where the cladisto-space is sampled every 5 Ma and the mode of evolution is assumed to be gradual (data is selected from the descendant or the ancestor based on branch length; see main text for details).
\end{enumerate}
We also rarefied both datasets for all the metrics and all the methods using the minimum of three taxa for the interval methods, and eight taxa for the slices methods.

\section{Supplemental Experimental Procedures}

\subsection{Estimating ancestral character states}
Where there was missing character data for a taxon we followed the method of \cite{Claddis} and treated missing data as any possible observed state for each character (see supplementary information).
For example, if a character had two observed states ($0$ and $1$) across all taxa, we attributed the multi-state ``$0$\&$1$" value to the taxon with missing data, representing an equal probability of being either $0$ or $1$.
This allows the ancestral node of a taxon with missing data to be estimated with no assumptions other than that the taxon has one of the observed character states.
To prevent poor ancestral state reconstructions from biasing our results, especially when a lot of error is associated with the reconstruction, we only included ancestral state reconstructions with a scaled Likelihood $\geq$ $0.95$.
Ancestral state reconstructions with scaled Likelihoods below this threshold were replaced by missing data (``?'').

\subsection{Data availability and reproducibility}
All data mentioned in this paper are available Figshare (\url{http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1539545}).
Code for reproducing the analyses is available on GitHub (\url{github.com/TGuillerme/SpatioTemporal_Disparity}).
