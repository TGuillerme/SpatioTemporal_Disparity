\subsection{Rarefied analysis}
This section contains the results from the rarefied Mammaliaformes and Eutheria datasets (see methods section in the main text for details).

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

    \includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true]{Figures/Main_results_rarefied.pdf}
\caption{Rarefied disparity through time in Eutheria and Mammaliaformes calculated using a model of punctuated (upper panels) or gradual (lower panels) evolution. The x axis represents time in millions of years before the present (Ma). The y axis represents disparity, measured as the median distance between the centroid of the ordinated space and the tips/nodes in each time subsample. The solid black lines show the mean disparity estimated from 1000 bootstrapped pseudoreplicates and confidence intervals (CI) are represented by the grey polygons (50\% CI in dark grey and 95\% CI in light grey). The dashed line and the right hand axis represents the number of tips/nodes in each time slice. The red vertical line indicates the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary (66 Ma). Note that scale bars differ among panels.}

\subsection{Other disparity measurements}
This section contains the results of the analysis of the Mammaliaformes and Eutherian data set with all the disparity measurements and methods for sampling disparity through time.
The different disparity measurements are the median distance from centroid (see methods section in the main text for details) as well as the median sum and products of ranges and variances from \cite{Wills1994}.
The different methods for sampling disparity through time are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Intervals (tips only)}. We selected every tips present at every stages from the early Middle Jurassic (Bajocian, starting at 170.3 Mya) to the present. We collapsed together every stage containing less than 3 tips. Note that some tips where present in multiple stages due to their occurrence data (see methods section in the main text for details on the occurrence data).
\item \textbf{Intervals (tips and nodes)}. We selected every stage tips and nodes present at every stages from the early Middle Jurassic (Bajocian, starting at 170.3 Mya) to the present. We collapsed together every stage containing less than 3 elements (tips and/or nodes).
\item \textbf{Slices (punctuated)}. These are the results presented in the main text where time is sample equidistantly and evolution is assumed to be punctuated (randomly selecting either data from the descendant or the ancestor when slicing through a branch; see methods section in the main text for details).
\item \textbf{Slices (punctuated: acctran)}. Similar as slices (punctuated) method but data is always selected from the descendant (see methods section in the main text for details).
\item \textbf{Slices (punctuated: deltran)}. Similar as slices (punctuated) method but data is always selected from the ancestor (see methods section in the main text for details).
\item \textbf{Slices (gradual)}. SThese are the results presented in the main text where time is sample equidistantly and evolution is assumed to be gradual (data is selected from the descendant or the ancestor based on branch length; see methods section in the main text for details).
\end{enumerate}
We also rarefied both data sets for all the metrics and all the methods using only 3 taxa for the interval methods and 8 taxa for the slices methods.
