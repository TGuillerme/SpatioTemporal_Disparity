\begin{abstract}
% NC: As ever I'm ignoring this until we are finished with the rest!
%Massive global extinctions have a turn-over effect on biodiversity. When some large group of taxa suffers from a high rate of extinction, it is expected that niches becomes available for potentially unrelated clades that can undergo an adaptive radiation to fill these vacant niches.
%Therefore, in a context of current global biotic and abiotic changes, resolving this question is crucial to understand the effect of mass extinction events on biodiversity.
%The causes and effects of such events are well understood for marine organisms with a good fossil record (e.g. Ammonoidea and Foraminifera) but the effects remains unclear on some iconic vertebrate groups.

%Typically, placental mammals (eutherians) are shown by some studies to be undergoing an adaptive radiation after the Cretaceous-Palaeogene mass extinction event (K-Pg) by originating shortly before the K-Pg event and displaying high morphological evolutionary rates leading to high diversification during the Palaeogene. However, some other studies have demonstrated that eutherians originates during the Cretaceous and don't display significantly high diversification after the K-Pg event.

%Here we propose a new approach to test if eutherians undergo an adaptive radiation after the K-Pg event. We use trees containing both living and fossil taxa based on all the available data (Total Evidence) and the state-of-the-art method in dating (tip dating) along side with a better proxy for niche occupancy (morphological diversity as opposed to taxonomic diversity) and finer grain analysis through time (introducing a time slicing method).

%Our results shows that mammals don't display significantly changes in morphological disparity that expected under a Brownian motion after the K-Pg boundary. We therefore propose that eutherian mammals don't undergo an adaptive radiation during the Palaeogene.

%Why is our stuff better?
%1-More accurate timing (TEM+tip dating vs. molecular node date or morphological parsimony)
%2-Better proxy for niche occupancy (morphological disparity + diversity vs. species diversity) (but niches concept is shite anyway)
%3-Better measure for disparity (centroid distance vs. Foote's quartet)
%4-Two evolutionary models instead of one for looking at disparity through time (punctuated+constant vs. punctuate)
%5-Systematic time units for looking at disparity through time (slices vs. intervals)

\section{Introduction}
% 1§ mass extinctions = bad. Loss of species (e.g. P/T 95%). But what comes after is more interesting
Throughout history, life on Earth has suffered a series of mass extinction events resulting in drastic declines in global biodiversity \citep[e.g.][]{RaupPT,BentonPT,rennetime2013,Brusatte2015}.
The long-term effects of mass extinctions, however, are more varied \citep{Erwin1998344}, and include species richness increases in some clades \citep{friedmanexplosive2010} and declines in others \citep{Benton85}, changes in morphological diversity \citep{Ciampaglio2001,Ciampaglio2004,kornextinction2013} and shifts in ecological dominance \citep[e.g.][]{Brusatte12092008,toljagictriassic-jurassic2013,bensonfaunal2014}.
These shifts are characterized by the decline of one clade that is replaced by a different unrelated clade with a similar ecological role (e.g. Brachiopoda and Bivalvia at the end Permian extinction; \citealt{Sepkiski1981,CLAPHAM01102006,Liow2015} but see \citealt{Payne22052014}). 
Shifts in ecological dominance are of particular interest because they are a fairly common pattern observed in the fossil record (e.g. Foraminifera; \citealt{D'Hondt01011996,Coxall01042006}; Ichtyosauria; \citealt{thorneresetting2011}; Plesiosauria; \citealt{bensonfaunal2014}) and are often linked to major macroevolutionary processes such as adaptive \citep{Losos2010} or competitive \citep{Brusatte12092008} radiations.

% 2§ explaining the rise of the age of the mammals view.
One classical example of a shift in ecological dominance is at the Cretaceous-Palaeogene (K-Pg) mass extinction 66 million years ago \citep{rennetime2013}, where many terrestrial vertebrates (including the dominant non-avian dinosaur group; \citealt{archibald2011extinction,rennetime2013,Brusatte2015}) went extinct, allowing placental mammals to dominate the fauna \citep{archibald2011extinction,Lovergrove}. 
Some authors suggest this reflects placental mammals filling the ``empty'' niches left after the K-Pg extinction event \citep{archibald2011extinction}, others suggest it reflects a release from predation and/or competition \citep{Lovergrove}.
However, evidence for the diversification of placental mammals being driven by the K-Pg extinction event is mixed.
Thorough analysis of the fossil record \citep[e.g.][]{goswamia2011,O'Leary08022013} supports the idea that placental mammals diversified after the K-Pg extinction event as there are no undebated placental mammal fossils before it and many afterwards \citep{archibald2011extinction,goswamia2011,Slater2012MEE,O'Leary08022013,Wilson2013,Brusatte2015}. 
Conversely, evidence from molecular data suggests that the diversification of placental mammals started prior to the K-Pg extinction event without being drastically affected by it \citep[e.g.][]{Douady2003285,bininda2007delayed,meredithimpacts2011,Stadler12042011}.
Therefore, whether the diversification of placental mammals began before the K-Pg extinction event, or in response to the extinctions at K-Pg, is a matter of great debate \citep{dosReis2012,O'Leary08022013,Springer09082013,O’Leary09082013,dosReis2014}. 

There are two main reasons why there is still debate about the timing of the diversification of placental mammals. 
Firstly, palaeontological and neontological data show different patterns; palaeontological data generally suggest that placental mammals diversified after K-Pg \citep[e.g.][]{O'Leary08022013}, whereas neontological data suggest that K-Pg extinction event had little to no effect on mammalian diversification \citep{bininda2007delayed,meredithimpacts2011,Stadler12042011}.
We can solve this issue by using both palaeontological and neontological data in our analyses. 
The Total Evidence method allows us to use cladistic data for both living and fossil taxa, along with molecular data for living taxa, to build phylogenies \citep{eernissetaxonomic1993,ronquista2012}.
This method can also be combined with the tip-dating method \citep{ronquista2012,Wood01032013} to get more accurate estimates of diversification times for both fossil and living species \citep[but see][]{Arcila2015131}.
Here we use two recent Total Evidence tip-dated phylogenies of mammals \citep{Slater2012MEE,beckancient2014} to investigate palaeontological and neontological taxa simultaneously.

   % NC: Not really sure this fits anywhere?
    %Recently, two study have been published using the Total Evidence and tip-dating methods to study (1) variation in mammalian body mass \citep{Slater2012MEE} and (2) diversification rates \citep{beckancient2014} around the K-Pg boundary.
    % Slater: clear effect of the K-Pg boundary on body size constraint (body size evolution is OU before K-Pg and becomes BM afterwards)
    %\cite{Slater2012MEE} found good support for a shift in the mode of mammalian body mass evolution before and after the K-Pg boundary suggesting a clear effect of the K-Pg boundary on mammalian body mass diversification.
    % Beck: mixed (support for both no effect of K-Pg (ancient dates hypothesis) or for a possible more explosive model (accelerated rates))
    %Whereas, \cite{beckancient2014} found mixed result on diversification rates supporting both a diversification of placental mammals before (``ancient dates'' hypothesis) or after (``accelerated rates'' hypothesis) the K-Pg boundary. % TG: or maybe we don't give a flip about the hypothesis names (especially since they are the first words of the paper title)

A second issue is that diversity can be defined in many different ways.
In many studies it is measured as taxonomic diversity or species richness \citep{Stadler12042011,meredithimpacts2011,O'Leary08022013}, but often the more interesting aspect of diversity is related to the ecological niches the species occupy \citep{Wesley-Hunt2005,Brusatte12092008,toljagictriassic-jurassic2013}, particularly if we want to make hypotheses about macroevolutionary processes \citep{Pearman2008149,OlsonRadiation,Losos2010,glor2010phylogenetic,benton2015}.
Sometimes taxonomic diversity is used as a proxy for other kinds of diversity, however, species richness can be decoupled from morphological diversity \citep[e.g.][]{slaterCetacean,ruta2013,hopkinsdecoupling2013}, so it may not be the best proxy for ecological diversity.
We can instead use morphological diversity, also known as disparity \citep[e.g.][]{Wills1994,Erwin2007,Hughes20082013}, as a way to quantify changes in mammalian morphology that should relate to the ecology of the species.
    % 6§ But disparity is outdated
However some methods for measuring disparity are outdated and make inappropriate assumptions.
Many methods for quantifying changes in morphological diversity were proposed $>$ 20 years ago \citep{Foote01071994,Wills1994} and are sometimes used without modifications \citep[e.g.,][]{brusatte50,Brusatte12092008,cisneros2010,thorneresetting2011,prentice2011,brusattedinosaur2012,toljagictriassic-jurassic2013,ruta2013,bentonmodels2014,bensonfaunal2014}, even when the statistical assumptions of the methods are violated (see Methods).
Additionally, previous methods are based on an underlying assumption that changes in disparity occur by punctuated evolution \citep[e.g.][]{Wesley-Hunt2005} which is not always the case \citep{Hunt21042015}.
Finally, most studies of disparity through time use unequal time units based on biostratigraphy \citep{Brusatte12092008,brusattedinosaur2012,toljagictriassic-jurassic2013}. 
This can be tautological as biostratigraphy is already based on changes in fossil assemblages and morphology through time.
To deal with these issues, we propose an updated approach to test whether mammals diversified before or after K-Pg, using morphological disparity, measured as cladistic disparity (see Methods), as our proxy for diversity.

Here we measure the disparity of living and fossil mammals before or after K-Pg, using data taken from two previously published studies \citep{Slater2012MEE,beckancient2014}. 
Using a novel time-slicing approach, we produce fine-grained estimates of disparity through time under two different models of morphological character evolution (either gradual or punctuated). 
We also test whether mammals display significant changes in disparity between the end of the Cretaceous and throughout the Cenozoic.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to approach the debate about the effects of the K-Pg extinction event on mammalian evolution using Total Evidence phylogenies and by calculating disparity through time in a continuous way \citep[but see][for a similar question]{halliday2013testing}.
We find no significant changes in mammalian disparity between the end of the Cretaceous and any time during the Cenozoic.
These results suggest that the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs and other terrestrial vertebrate clades at the end of the Cretaceous did not affect mammalian morphological evolution.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Cladistic data and phylogenies}
We used the cladistic morphological matrices and the Total Evidence tip-dated trees \citep{ronquista2012} from \citet[][103 taxa with 446 morphological characters]{Slater2012MEE} and \citet[][102 taxa with 421 morphological characters]{beckancient2014}.
We chose these two datasets because they have a similar number of taxa and morphological characters.
\cite{Slater2012MEE} ranges from 310 million years ago (Ma; Late Carboniferous) to the present and focuses on the clade Mammaliaformes at the family-level.
\cite{beckancient2014} ranges from 170 Ma (Middle Jurassic) to the present and focuses on Eutheria at the genus-level.
We used the first and last occurrences reported in \cite{Slater2012MEE} and \cite{beckancient2014} as the temporal range of each taxon in our analysis.
Both phylogenies are illustrated in the supplementary material (see Fig S1 and S2 @@@).
%
Both trees contain few taxa compared to the overall species richness of living and fossil mammals \citep{wilson2005mammal,archibald2011extinction}. %TG: or actually maybe cite the book on my desk in Dublin.
This is because Total Evidence trees need a lot of data, particularly morphological data for living taxa that can be hard to locate \citep{MissingMammals}.
Therefore, most Total Evidence studies to date contain one or two orders of magnitude fewer taxa than phylogenies based solely on molecular data (e.g. thousands of taxa in \citealt{bininda2007delayed,meredithimpacts2011} \textit{vs.} hundreds in \citealt{ronquista2012,Slater2012MEE,Wood01032013,beckancient2014}).


\subsection{Estimating ancestral character states}
For both datasets we used the re-rooting method \citep{Yang01121995,Garland2000} to get Maximum Likelihood estimates of the ancestral states for each character at every node in the tree, using the \texttt{rerootingMethod} function from the \texttt{R} package \texttt{phytools} version 0.4-45 \citep{phytools,R}.
Where there was missing character data for a taxon we followed the method of \cite{Claddis} and treated missing data as any possible observed state for each character.
For example, if a character had two observed states ($0$ and $1$) across all taxa, we attributed the multi-state ``$0$\&$1$" value to the taxon with missing data, representing an equal probability of being either $0$ or $1$.
This allows the ancestral node of a taxon with missing data to be estimated with no assumptions other than that the taxon has one of the observed character states.
To prevent poor ancestral state reconstructions from biasing our results, especially when a lot of error is associated with the reconstruction, we only included ancestral state reconstructions with a scaled Likelihood $\geq$ $0.95$.
Ancestral state reconstructions with scaled Likelihoods below this threshold were replaced by missing data (``?'').

\subsection{Building the cladisto-space}
To explore variations in mammalian disparity through time (defined here as the variation in morphologies through time), we used a cladisto-space approach \citep[e.g.][]{Foote01071994,Foote29111996,Wesley-Hunt2005,Brusatte12092008,friedmanexplosive2010,toljagictriassic-jurassic2013,Hughes20082013}.
This approach is similar to constructing a morphospace based on continuous morphological data \citep[e.g.][]{friedmanexplosive2010}, except a cladisto-space is an approximation of the morphospace based on cladistic data (i.e. the discrete morphological characters used to build a phylogenetic tree).
Mathematically, a cladisto-space is an $n$ dimensional object that summarizes the cladistic distances between the taxa present in a cladistic matrix (see details below).
Although empirically inter-taxon distances are the same in a morphospace or a cladisto-space \citep{foth2012different,hetherington2015cladistic}, we prefer the term cladisto-space to make it clear that this space is estimated using cladistic data and not morphometric data and because both objects have slightly different properties.
For example, because of its inherent combinatory properties, a cladisto-space is a finite theoretical object limited by the product of the number of character states, whereas a morphospace is an infinite theoretical object.
Thus a cladisto-space will be overloaded if the number of taxa is higher than the product of the number of character states, although this is rarely an issue with empirical data (our cladisto-spaces have maximal capacities of $1.9$$\times$$10^{181}$ taxa, i.e. 101 orders of magnitude more taxa than the number of particles in the universe; \citealp{Slater2012MEE}, and $4.5$$\times$$10^{159}$ taxa; \citealp{beckancient2014}).

To estimate the cladisto-spaces for each of our datasets we first constructed pairwise distance matrices of length $k$, where $k$ is the total number of taxa in the dataset. 
For each dataset separately, we calculated the $k$$\times$$k$ distances using the Gower distance \citep{Gower71}, i.e. the Euclidean distance between two taxa divided by the number of shared characters. 
This allows us to correct for distances between two taxa that share many characters and could be closer to each other than to taxa with fewer characters in common (i.e. because some pairs of taxa share more characters in common than others, they are more likely to be similar).
For cladistic matrices, using this corrected distance is preferable to the raw Euclidean distance because of its ability to deal with discrete or/and ordinated characters as well as with missing data \citep{anderson2012using}.
However, the Gower distance cannot calculate distances when taxa have no overlapping data.
Therefore, we used the \texttt{TrimMorphDistMatrix} function from the \texttt{Claddis} R package \citep{Claddis} to remove pairs of taxa with no cladistic characters in common.
This led to us removing 11 taxa from the Mammaliaformes dataset \citep{Slater2012MEE} but none from the Eutheria dataset \citep{beckancient2014}.

%\subsubsection{Ordination}
After calculating our distance matrices we transformed them using classical multidimensional scaling \citep[MDS;][]{torgerson1965multidimensional,GOWER01121966,cailliez1983analytical}.
This method (also referred to as PCO; e.g. \citealt{Brusatte2015}; or PCoA; e.g. \citealt{paradisape:2004}) is an eigen decomposition of the distance matrix.
Because we used Gower distances instead of raw Euclidean distances, negative eigenvalues can be calculated.
To avoid this problem, we first transformed the distance matrices by applying the Cailliez correction \citep{cailliez1983analytical} which adds a constant $c^*$ to the values in a distance matrix (apart from the diagonal) so that all the Gower distances become Euclidean ($d_{Gower}+c^*=d_{Euclidean}$; \citealt{cailliez1983analytical}). 
We were then able to extract $n$ eigenvectors for each matrix (representing the $n$ dimensions of the cladisto-space) where $n$ is equal to $k-2$, i.e. the number of taxa in the matrix ($k$) minus the last two eigenvectors that are always null after applying the Cailliez correction.
Contrary to previous studies \citep[e.g][]{brusatte50,cisneros2010,prentice2011,anderson2012using,Hughes20082013,bentonmodels2014}, we use all $n$ dimensions of our cladisto-spaces and not a subsample representing the majority of the variance in the distance matrix (e.g. selecting only $m$ dimensions that represent up to 90\% of the variance in the distance matrix; \citealt{Brusatte12092008,toljagictriassic-jurassic2013}).

Note that our cladisto-spaces represent an ordination of all possible mammalian morphologies coded in each study through time.
It is unlikely that all morphologies will co-occur at each time point, therefore, the disparity of the whole cladisto-space is expected to be greater than the disparity at any specific point in time.

\subsection{Calculating disparity}
Disparity can be estimated in many different ways \citep[e.g.][]{Wills1994,Ciampaglio2004,thorneresetting2011,hopkinsdecoupling2013,huang2015origins}, however most studies estimate disparity using four metrics: the sum and products of ranges and variances, each of which gives a slightly different estimate of how the data fits within the cladisto-space \citep{Foote01071994,Wills1994,brusatte50,Brusatte12092008,cisneros2010,thorneresetting2011,prentice2011,brusattedinosaur2012,toljagictriassic-jurassic2013,ruta2013,bentonmodels2014,bensonfaunal2014}.
%The sum and products of ranges and variances are based on the ranges and variances of the eigenvectors calculated from a distance matrix. 
%However, these metrics do not take into account the covariance among eigenvectors. % TG: I think I need a bit of chat with Dr Jackson here. He's statement that sum of variance is not correct because it ignores covariance might be actually not a good argument. He's still right but in practice, the covariance between the eigenvectors seems to be always 0 (because each axis are orthogonal to each other). It doesn't change anything for our story but it might be good to no state that these variance calculations are wrong if they are ok (in practice, again, in theory, they remain wrong). % NC: Up to you. You could cut this whole section and just say we use centroids like Wills to estimate disparity.
%This is only statistically valid if the eigenvectors are independent.
%In multidimensional scaling, all $n$ eigenvectors are calculated from the same distance matrix and are therefore not independent, thus covariances among eigenvectors should be included when estimating disparity.
%
Nonetheless, these methods suffer several methodological caveats.
First, the range metrics are affected by the uneven sampling of the fossil record \citep{Butler2012}
Second, because we include all $n$ dimensions in the analysis (see above), the products of ranges and variances will tend towards zero since the scores of the last dimension are usually really close to zero themselves. 
These features make using the sum and products of ranges and variances unfeasible in our study.
Instead, we use a different metric that comes with no statistical assumptions for measuring the dispersion of the data in the cladisto-space: the median distance between taxa and the centroid (similar but not equivalent to \citealt{Wills1994,kornextinction2013,huang2015origins}) calculated as:

\begin{equation}
   Disparity=median{\displaystyle\sqrt{\sum{(\mathbf{v}_{n}-Centroid_{n})^2}}}
    \label{disparity}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
    Centroid_{n}=\frac{\displaystyle\sum(\mathbf{v}_{n})}{k} 
    \label{centroid}
\end{equation}

\noindent
and $\mathbf{v}_{n}$ is any of the $n$ eigenvectors (i.e. any of the $n$ dimensions of the cladisto-space), $Centroid_{n}$ is the mean value of the $n^{th}$ eigenvector (equation \ref{centroid}) and $k$ is the total number of taxa and nodes.
Note that we also calculated the sum and products of ranges and variances and refer to these results in the supplementary material (@@@). % link to supp.

\subsection{Estimating disparity through time} 
Changes in disparity through time are generally investigated by calculating the disparity of taxa that occupy the cladisto-space during specific time intervals \citep[e.g][]{cisneros2010,prentice2011,Hughes20082013,hopkinsdecoupling2013,bentonmodels2014,bensonfaunal2014}.
These time intervals are usually defined based on biostratigraphy \citep[e.g.][]{cisneros2010,prentice2011,Hughes20082013,bentonmodels2014} but can also be arbitrarily chosen time periods of equal duration \citep{Butler2012,hopkinsdecoupling2013,bensonfaunal2014}.
However, this approach suffers from two main biases. 
First, if biostratigraphy is used to determine the time intervals, disparity may be distorted towards higher differences between time intervals because biostratigraphical periods are geologically defined based on differences in the morphology of fossils found in the different strata.
Second, this approach assumes that all characters evolve following a punctuated equilibrium model, because disparity is only estimated once for each interval resulting in all changes in disparity occurring between intervals, rather than also allowing for gradual changes within intervals \citep{Hunt21042015}.

To address these issues, we used a ``time-slicing'' approach that considers subsets of taxa in the cladisto-space at specific equidistant points in time, as opposed to considering subsets of taxa between two points in time.
This results in even-sampling of the cladisto-space across time and permits us to define the underlying model of character evolution (punctuated or gradual).  
In practice, time-slicing considers the disparity of any element present in the phylogeny (branches, nodes and tips) at any point in time.
When the phylogenetic elements are nodes or tips, the eigenvector scores for the nodes (estimated using ancestral state reconstruction as described above) or tips are directly used for estimating disparity.
When the phylogenetic elements are branches we chose the eigenvector score for the branch using one of two evolutionary models:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{\textbf{Punctuated evolution.}} 
    This model selects the eigenvector score from either the ancestral node or the descendant node/tip of the branch regardless of the position of the slice along the branch. 
    Similarly to the time interval approach, this reflects a model of punctuated evolution where changes in disparity occur either at the start or at the end of a branch over a relatively short time period and clades undergo long periods of stasis during their evolution \citep{Gould1977,Hunt20112007}.
    We applied this model in three ways: 
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
      \item selecting the eigenvector score of the ancestral node of the branch (ACCTRAN).
      \item selecting the eigenvector score of the descendant node/tip of the branch (DELTRAN).
      \item randomly selecting either the eigenvector score of the ancestral node or the descendant node/tip of the branch (random).
    \end{enumerate}
    Method (i) assumes that changes always occur early on the branch (accelerated transition, ACCTRAN) and (ii) assumes that changes always occur later (delayed transition, DELTRAN).
    We prefer not to make either assumption so we report the results from (iii), although the ACCTRAN and DELTRAN results are available in the Supplementary Information @@@. % link
    \item{\textbf{Gradual evolution.}}
    This model also selects the eigenvector score from either the ancestral node or the descendant node/tip of the branch, but the choice depends on the distance between the sampling time point and the end of the branch.
    If the sampling time point falls in the first half of the branch length the eigenvector score is taken from the ancestral node, conversely, if the sampling time point falls in the second half of the branch length the eigenvector score is taken from the descendant node/tip.
    This reflects a model of gradual evolution where changes in disparity are gradual and cumulative along the branch.
    Under this model, the gradual changes could be either directional or random, however, directional evolution have been empirically shown to be rare \citep[only 5\% of the time][]{Hunt20112007}.
    We therefore considered that changes from a character state A to B were only dependent on the branch length.
\end{enumerate}
%What did we do (the main figure)
We applied our time-slicing approach separately to the two cladisto-spaces calculated for Mammaliaformes \citep{Slater2012MEE} and Eutheria \citep{beckancient2014}, time-slicing the phylogeny every five million years from 170 Ma to the present resulting in 35 subsamples of the cladisto-space.
For each subsample, we estimated its disparity assuming punctuated (ACCTRAN, DELTRAN and random) and gradual evolution as described above.
To reduce the influence of outliers on our disparity estimates, we bootstrapped each disparity measurement by randomly resampling with replacement a new subsample of taxa from the observed taxa in the subsample 1000 times.
We then calculated the median disparity value for each subsample along with the 50\% and 95\% confidence intervals.
We also recorded the number of phylogenetic elements (nodes and tips) in each subsample as a proxy for taxonomic diversity.
To compare our results to previous studies we also repeated our analyses using the time interval approach based on biostratigraphy \citep[e.g.][]{cisneros2010,prentice2011,Hughes20082013,bentonmodels2014} using each geological stage from the Middle Jurassic to the present.
We report the results of these analyses in the Supplementary Materials (@@@). % link

%Testing the difference section
\subsection{Testing the effects of the K-Pg extinction on mammalian disparity}
If the K-Pg extinction event had a significant effect on mammalian disparity, we should see a significant difference between disparity at the end of the Cretaceous and disparity at the start of the Paleogene.
To test this, we performed t-tests among the time subsamples before and after the K-Pg boundary 66 million years ago, i.e. the subsamples at 70 and 65 Ma \citep[e.g. as used in]{anderson2012using,zelditch2012geometric,smith2014joined}, for both Mammaliaformes and Eutheria and using both the gradual and punctuated evolutionary models.
Because the effect of a mass extinction event on a group's evolution might not be detectable directly after the event due to delays in recovery \citep{chen2012timing,chen2014complete} %will find that one later one FIND THE DURATION OF LAG FROM THERE
, we also tested whether there was a significant difference in disparity between the end of the Cretaceous and any subsample from the Paleocene and the Eocene (up to the Late Priabonian; 35 Ma).
Because these analyses involved multiple t-tests, we used Bonferonni correction \citep{holm1979simple} on the significant p-values.

%Moved that from above for explaining the rarefaction
Finally, disparity may be higher in subsamples with more phylogenetic elements simply because there are more taxa represented.
To test whether this influenced our results, we repeated the t-tests using the rarefied Mammaliaformes and Eutheria disparities.
In the Mammaliaformes, the minimum number of taxa in each subsample from 170 Ma to present was eight.
In the Eutheria, the minimum number of taxa in each subsample was three, however, from 150 Ma until the present, the minimum number of taxa is eight.
To make both datasets comparable, we used eight as a minimum number of taxa for the rarefied bootstrap measurements, therefore in the Eutheria we ignored the subsample between 170 and 150 Ma that only contains three taxa.

% NC: I wonder whether you need to mention slater and beck every single time, could just say eutheria or mammaliaformes.
% TG: ok, will standardise later on.

% we first tested whether there was a significant effect of time on disparity using \cite{permanova}'s Permutational Analysis of Variance \citep[also referred to as PERMANOVA or NPANOVA; e.g.][]{brusatte50,ruta2013}.
% We calculated the Euclidean distance of the ordinated data with 1000 permutations on both datasets and on both evolutionary scenarios using the \texttt{adonis} function from the R package \texttt{vegan} \citep{vegan}.
% NC: I feel like there are details missing here - what's the explanatory variable and the response etc. 

% When we found a significant effect of time on disparity % NC: Again there's a bit missing here but should be easy to fix.
% , we ran a series of \textit{post-hoc} t-tests among the time subsamples before and after the K-Pg boundary \citep{anderson2012using,zelditch2012geometric,smith2014joined} as follows.
% We measured the difference between the last subsample of the Cretaceous (65 Ma) to all the slices of the Cenozoic to test whether there was either:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item{no effect of the K-Pg event: no significant difference between the last Cretaceous subsample and any of the Cenozoic subsamples.}
%     \item{a direct effect of the K-Pg event: significant difference between the last Cretaceous subsample and the first Cenozoic subsample.}
%     \item{a lag effect of the K-Pg event: a significant difference between the last Cretaceous subsample and some subsamples during the Cenozoic.}
% \end{enumerate}
% Because these \textit{post-hoc} t-tests involve multiple comparisons, we corrected each p-value by multiplying them by the number of comparisons \citep[Holm-Bonferonni correction;][]{holm1979simple}.

% TG: I think the following part can go to the supplementaries. I know we discussed various test together (before vs. after KT; patterns of changes during the whole time; and lag test). However, I think the only test that answers our question is the lag effect o
% \begin{enumerate}
  % \item{all the slices before and after the K-Pg boundary (hereafter referred as the \textit{``K-Pg test''})} % Not sure about this one. If it shows a difference, why should it be due to KT limit? Why not just time dependent?
%   \item{each slices taken sequentially (hereafter referred as the \textit{``sequential test''})}
%   \item{the last slice of the Cretaceous and every slice of the Tertiary (hereafter referred as the \textit{``lag test''})}
% \end{enumerate}
% Each of these test are detecting different aspects in changes in disparity.
% The ``K-Pg test'' was chosen to detect an overall difference between the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic; the ``sequential test'' was chosen to describe the overall pattern of changes in disparity since the Jurassic; the ``lag test'' was chosen to detect any lag in potential changes in disparity after the K-Pg boundary event.

\section{Results}
%§1 - How does disparity change through time?
Disparity in Eutheria \citep[data from][]{beckancient2014} reaches a plateau at the end of the Jurassic (150 Ma) and in the mean time, the number of tips and nodes (i.e. a proxy for taxonomic richness) increases up to the K-Pg boundary and then decreases throughout the Cenozoic (Fig \ref{fig:Fig_Raw_results}).
These changes in disparity do not appear to be fully linked to the number of tips and nodes used to estimate disparity.
Changes in disparity among Mammaliaformes \citep[data from][]{Slater2012MEE}, however, are more idiosyncratic (Fig \ref{fig:Fig_Raw_results}).
In fact, disparity reaches a plateau during the Anisian (middle Triassic; 245 Ma) and fluctuates during the rest of the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic (Fig @@@ supplementary).
Contra to the patterns observed in Eutheria, disparity changes seems to be more linked to the number of tips and nodes available for estimating disparity (Fig \ref{fig:Fig_Raw_results}).
Note that both evolutionary models (gradual or punctuated) seems to yield to sensibly similar results (Fig \ref{fig:Fig_Raw_results}).
When we tested for a direct effect of the K-Pg boundary on both data sets and under both evolutionary models, we found no significant differences in disparity between the last subsample of the Cretaceous (70 Ma) and the first sub-sample of the Paleogene (65 Ma; Tables \ref{tab:Tab_beck} and \ref{tab:Tab_slater}).
When testing for a lag effect after the K-Pg boundary, we found no significant differences in disparity between the last subsample of the Cretaceous (70 Ma) and any subsamples of the Paleocene and the Eocene in Mammaliaformes under both evolutionary models and in Eutheria under a gradual evolutionary model (Tables \ref{tab:Tab_beck} and \ref{tab:Tab_slater}).
However, in Eutheria under punctuated evolutionary model, we found a significant difference (even after applying Bonferonni correction) in disparity between the last subsample of the Cretaceous (70 Ma) and the subsamples at 50 Ma (Late Ypressian) and 40 Ma (Bartonian; Table \ref{tab:Tab_beck})

% TG: I'm now not entirely sure if this is relevant here. In the end we found no signif results appart from two during the Eocene that we discuss in the discussion (effect of PETM?).
Next, we tested whether the previous results were linked to changes in the number of available nodes and tips (i.e. as a proxy for taxonomic diversity) by rarefying the data set to a maximum of height nodes or tips per time slices (see Fig supplementary @@@).
We found no differences between the last subsample of the Cretaceous (70 Ma) and any subsamples of the Paleocene and the Eocene for both data sets under both evolutionary models (see Tables supplementary @@@).

PETM caveat: in the Eutheria data set however, we detected a possible significant lag effect during the Eocene suggesting that mammalian disparity did slightly increased (yet significantly) after the K-Pg boundary.
However, these increases only occur as late as 20 and 30 million years after the K-Pg boundary.
It would be therefore spurious to link these increases in disparity only to the K-Pg boundary, especially since they occur after the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum event (PETM; $\sim$56 Ma) that was the theatre of big faunal changes especially in mammals (CITE).

t-test caveats: not really correct bus best way yet \citep{anderson2012using & co.}
another way could be to do sequential regressions with the intercept in at each time-slice being estimated from the former time-slice regression (Jackson pers. com.) but this method would not get rid of the fact that our subsamples are not independant and, by definition, strongly correlate trhough time and phylogenty.

\section{Discussion}
%Our results show that there is a significant effect of time on changes in disparity under the assumption of gradual evolution in Mammaliaformes and Eutherians as well as under the assumption of punctuated evolution for Eutherians (Table \ref{tab:Tab_permanova}). % NC: Do they?
% NC: This is more results than discussion
%However, regardless the taxonomic level (i.e. family \textit{vs.} genus) and regardless the evolutionary model (i.e. gradual or punctuated evolution), there is no significant difference in disparity between the latests Cretaceous subsample and any of the Cenozoic subsamples (Fig \ref{fig:Fig_Rar_results}).
%In fact the disparity seems to reach a plateau at the end of the Jurassic (150 Ma) for Eutherians and during the late Triassic (Norian; 220 Ma) for the Mammaliaformes and stays relatively constant after that (see Fig \ref{fig:Fig_Rar_results} and S4 @@@).

Our results show that disparity changes through time in both Eutheria and Mammaliaformes.
Initially, disparity increases rapidly but then seems to reach a plateau at the end of the Jurassic (150 Ma@) for Eutheria, and during the late Triassic (Anisian; 245 Ma@) for the Mammaliaformes, and remains relatively constant after approximately 12\%@ and 25\%@ of their evolutionary history respectively.
These patterns of mammalian disparity are consistent with previous mammalian studies (\citealt{Close2015} but see \citealt{Grossnickle2013}) as well as with patterns of disparity in metazoans more generally \citep[e.g.][]{Hughes20082013}. 
Additionally, our analyses did not detect any effect of the K-Pg extinction event on mammalian disparity between 65 and 50 Ma @@@@. % NC: I removed "short term" as 15 million years is not really short...
This suggests that the numerous extinctions of terrestrial vertebrates, including the dominant non-avian dinosaur group, at the K-Pg boundary did not directly affect mammalian morphological evolution during the Cenozoic.
We do find evidence for an effect of K-Pg in Eutheria at around 55-50 Ma@@@, but this may reflect changes at the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum % NC: This needs to be added in light of the new results. Bit more to add on why it's probably not the K-Pg and probably not that interesting.

%Our analyses provide a new approach to this debate by using both living and fossil species as well as morphological diversity (disparity) rather than taxonomic diversity as a proxy for mammalian diversity. 
%Our findings might change the long-lasting idea that the non-avian dinosaurs where restraining mammal evolution \citep{Lovergrove} or that their extinction liberate ecology niches for mammals to evolve in \citep{archibald2011extinction}.
% NC: This seems more like a conclusion/abstract than the discussion.

There has been great debate about how mammalian evolution proceeded after the K-Pg boundary \citep{Stadler12042011,meredithimpacts2011,O'Leary08022013,dosReis2014}. 
Previous results have often been split by whether fossil or living data were used, with palaeontological studies finding evidence for mammalian diversity increasing rapidly after the K-Pg extinction event and neontological studies finding no evidence of an effect. 
%Our results differ from previous studies \citep[][ see below]{Grossnickle2013,Wilson2013} 
% NC: Add these in somewhere above?
Our analyses use both fossil and living taxa, and like the neontological analyses, we find no evidence for significant increases in mammalian disparity after K-Pg. % NC: Be more specific about dates of actual results
Interestingly our results are fundamentally different to those of \cite{Slater2012MEE}, the dataset on which our Mammaliaformes analyses are based. 
\cite{Slater2012MEE} showed evidence for a change in the mode of body-mass evolution at the K-Pg boundary, with mammalian body size evolution... % NC: how does it change? How does this relate to our hypotheses.
We are confident that our results are robust as we detected the same lack of effect of the K-Pg boundary from the independent Eutheria dataset \citep[i.e.][]{beckancient2014}.
The difference in our results may be related to differences in the number of traits used in \cite{Slater2012MEE} (one continuous trait: body mass) and the present study (446 discrete cladistic characters).
In addition, variation in morphology and variation in body mass are two different aspects of diversity and may be decoupled in the same way as taxonomic diversity is decoupled from disparity \citep{slaterCetacean,ruta2013,hopkinsdecoupling2013}, thus it is possible that body-mass evolution was influenced by the K-Pg extinction event, while overall disparity was not.

There are several caveats to bear in mind when interpreting our results. 
Firstly, both our datasets are limited taxonomically.
They do not represent all known mammalian taxa, especially during the Neogene (23--2.58 Ma) where there are no fossil taxa in either dataset.
Our study, however, focuses on changes in disparity around the K-Pg boundary and not during the whole Cenozoic.
Besides, this might not cause a serious underestimation of disparity, at least for the Mammaliaformes, because their diversity peaked during the late Cretaceous \citep[Campanian; 72.1--83.6 Ma;][]{Newham201432} and mammalian diversification rates declined throughout the Cenozoic \citep{Raia2012}.
Therefore, an effect of the K-Pg boundary would be more likely to be detected during the Paleogene when mammalian diversity was highest, so we do not beleive that increasing taxon sampling would alter our conclusions.

Secondly % NC: T-TESTS, MULTIPLE COMPARISONS ETC. You could use something else. Currently however everyone is doing t tests and we correct for multiple comparisons as best we can. (Doesn't need to be a long paragraph)

% Also, both datasets contains cladistic data for only a few living mammals which can also have a effect of topological accuracy \citep{GuillermeCooper,MissingMammals}.
% However, both original phylogenies where built using strong topological constraint to avoid such a caveat \citep{Slater2012MEE,beckancient2014}.

\subsection{Methodology improvements for measuring disparity}
Our results may differ from previous studies because of our specific methodological choices \citep[e.g. compared to][]{Grossnickle2013,Wilson2013}.
Throughout this paper, we propose several incremental changes to the classical ways of measuring disparity.
% These differences can be due to the different input data to calculate disparity (morphometric data in \citealt{Grossnickle2013}; and cladistic data in the present study; but see \citealt{foth2012different,hetherington2015cladistic}), the different method to calculate disparity through time (time bin in \citealt{Grossnickle2013}; and time slicing in the present study; see below) or the different focal morphological aspect (dental morphology in \citealt{Grossnickle2013}; and overall - including dental - morphology in the present study).
Firstly we used all the axes of the cladisto-space, as opposed to previous studies that selected a subsample of the cladisto-space arguing that the $m$ first axes usually contain most of the dataset's variance \citep[e.g][]{brusatte50,cisneros2010,prentice2011,anderson2012using,Hughes20082013,bentonmodels2014}.
We argue that even if the last dimensions of the cladisto-space contain a trivial amount of variance, there is no statistical justification to exclude them.
However, by doing so, we included dimensions of the cladisto-space with near $0$ variance and range (Mammaliaformes: variance = $2\times10^{-14}$, range = $7.31\times10^{-7}$; Eutheria: variance = $1.15\times10^{-15}$, range = $3.33\times10^{-7}$).
An alternative method avoids this problem by simply not ordinating the data and using the raw distance matrix \citep[e.g.][]{bensonfaunal2014,Close2015}. 
However, in both this method and our method, the calculation of the products of ranges and variances is impossible.

Secondly, we used median distance from centroid as a disparity metric, rather than the classical sums and products of ranges and variances \citep{} % NC CITATION?
This metric is not affected by problems with using the last dimensions of the cladisto-space (see above) and therefore has several advantages over other metrics. % NC: I'm assuming the next sentence is the advantages?
For example, this metric comes with no special statistical assumptions, and it appears to be less coupled with taxonomic diversity % NC: Need to explain where you got this from - your supp analyses?
(especially for the products of ranges and variance and the sum of ranges, see supplementary Figs @@@).

%Finally
Thirdly, we used a time-slicing method instead of binning the data into time intervals \citep[e.g in:][]{cisneros2010,prentice2011,Hughes20082013,hopkinsdecoupling2013,bentonmodels2014,bensonfaunal2014} thus allowing us to avoid two caveats of using the time intervals approach. Because time intervals are often based on biostratigraphy, which is in turn based on notable differences in fossil fauna and flora, this method is likely to artificially emphasize disparity differences among time intervals. It is also possible to use arbitrary time bins of equal duration rather than biostratigraphy \citep{Butler2012,hopkinsdecoupling2013,bensonfaunal2014}, but both approaches make the underlying assumption that disparity changes in a punctuated  manner, i.e. changes occur only between time intervals. However, gradual evolution has been shown to be relatively common in the fossil record \citep{Hunt20112007,Hunt21042015}, so this assumption is unfounded. Our approach allowed us to fit different evolutionary models to our data - either assuming punctuated or gradual evolution. This is an improvement on previous approaches but could be improved further by implementing other common but more complex models for example, a combined stasis and random walk \citep{Hunt21042015} or models based on morphological rates rather than just the sheer branch length.


%NC: OK I think this section can go. 1 - it sort of fits into the paragraph above a bit. 2 - it's more caveats than improvements and probably more detail than needed. Some of the caveats could go earlier

%Finally, using the time slicing method, allows use to crudely specify the evolutionary model for changes in disparity such as punctuated or gradual evolution and therefore test macroevolutionary hypotheses (such as in this paper) without assuming only one evolutionary model.
%For example, we find differences in disparity with such and such model ... or no difference at all with all of these models...
%TG: This part actually depends on the results. I am not sure if it's actually super relevant in this paper (I'd rather develop it properly for the disparity project).
% Within Eutheria, we showed both support for an effect of time on disparity under both models of evolution.
% This can reflect the complex combination between the two modes of evolution where morphology (i.e. as inferred from the cladistic data) varies stochastically through time with a mix of random walks (i.e. gradual model) for certain set of characters and stasis (i.e. punctuated model) for others.
% These results are consistent with previous findings \citep{Hunt20112007,Hunt21042015}.
% It is also encouraging to see that the distinction between the two modes of evolution can help understanding the patterns of changes in disparity at a finer scale.
% In fact, for Mammaliaformes, there is no significant effect of time on disparity under the assumption of a punctuated model of evolution but a clear effect of time when evolution is assumed to be gradual (see Table 1@@@).
% When looking at the details of this results, the same datasets shows also no significant effect of time when using the time bin method (including nodes) or when assuming that disparity evolves under an ACCTRAN model (see supplementary permanova results @@@).
% This suggests that there is an effect of time on Mammaliaformes with mix between punctuated delay evolution (DELTRAN) and gradual evolution (random walk).
% This could be interpreted as when a particular morphology (i.e. a set of particular states for cladistic characters) is observed within a clade, this particular morphology will be likely conserved through time.
%However, other common but more complex models could also be implemented such as a combined stasis and random walk \citep{Hunt21042015} or models based on morphological rates rather than just the sheer branch length.
%For example, one could use a density of probability for choosing the ordinated data for either the descendant or the ancestor based on morphological clocks rather than just branch length.

%Two major caveats, however, arise from using such a method.
%First, the time-slicing method relies on good estimates of characters states at the nodes of the phylogeny.
%Estimating discrete ancestral characters can sometimes be difficult leading to low scaled likelihood values supporting any states of a particular character, especially when many data are missing in the observed cladistic matrix.
%However, in this particular study, we made the methodological choice of selecting only characters with a high scaled likelihood support ($> 0.95$).
%Additionally, using trees containing fossil taxa also improves the ability to correctly estimate ancestral characters \citep{Poly2001,Finarelli2006,Albert2009,Slater2012MEE}.
%Finally, because, this method samples every phylogenetic element (tip, node or edge) through time, disparity calculated close to the root of the tree can exhibit result with large confidence intervals (e.g. when only three phylogenetic elements are sampled see Fig S3 and S@@@).
%However, it is encouraging to note that measuring disparity from time-slices is decoupled from taxonomic diversity at least after a minimal number of taxa \citep{slaterCetacean,ruta2013,hopkinsdecoupling2013}

\subsection{Conclusion}
Evidence for whether mammals diversified before or after the K-Pg boundary is unclear \citep{meredithimpacts2011,O'Leary08022013,dosReis2014,beckancient2014}, and appears to be related to the kind of data used (fossils or living species) and how the analyses were conducted.
%Among the variety of macroevolutionary process proposed to support an effect of the K-Pg boundary on mammalian evolution, some authors proposed the release of ecological niches after the K-Pg boundary \citep[e.g.][]{archibald2011extinction,O'Leary08022013} or a release of competition pressures \citep[e.g.][]{Slater2012MEE,Lovergrove}.
Using both fossil and living taxa, and investigating morphological disparity through time rather than taxonomic diversity, we find no direct effect of the K-Pg extinction event on the diversity of mammals. 
%We based our analysis on the palaeontological discoveries of the last decade showing an unprecedented and unexpected taxonomic and morphological diversity prior to the Cenozoic \citep{luo2007,Close2015}.
We therefore suggest that, contrary to popular belief, the extinction of many terrestrial vertebrates including the non-avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago, did not significantly affect the evolution of mammals throughout the Cenozoic.

% \subsection{Ancestral states estimation}
% We used both the \texttt{ace} function from the R package ape v. 3.2 \citep{paradisape:2004} and the 
% \texttt{rerootingMethod} function from the R package phytools 0.4-45 \citep{phytools}. Both method perform a maximum likelihood estimation of the ancestral values and the variance of a Brownian motion process based on the re-rooting method of \citep{Yang01121995}. The two methods differ slightly in the calculation of the normalized conditional likelihoods but mainly on the way to treat missing data. We optimised the \texttt{ace} function for fast estimation by treating missing data in the matrix as an extra character (e.g. if a character has two observed tips states 0 and 1 and a third tip has missing data (NA), the ancestor of these three tips can be estimated between the three following states: 0, 1 and NA). For the \texttt{rerootingMethod}, we followed \citep{Claddis} method and treated the missing in the tips as any possible observed state (e.g. if a character has two observed tips states 0 and 1 and a third tip has missing data (NA), the third tip will be considered as multi-state (0\&1) and the ancestor of these three tips can be estimated between the two following states: 0 and 1). Both methods perform similarly but the implementation of the \texttt{ace} function has a slightly lower accuracy  but is three times faster than the one for the \texttt{rerootingMethod} function (see supplementaries).
% % NC: Some of this probably belongs in methods

% \subsubsection{Time intervals}
% We then divide our observed cladisto-spaces into sub cladisto-spaces representing the different stages of the character-space filling. For example, if at various points in time.
% %The intervals should be a compromise between the resolution and the sample size and must be "sufficiently coards that nearly all generic first and last occurenaces can be unambiguously assigned" \citep{Foote01071994}.
% Time intervals from 170Ma (Earliest Cenomanian, Late Cretaceous) to the present.
% We count all the nodes/tips present in a given time interval.
% Classic but artificially grouping data. The minimal bin size should contain at least two nodes/tips and sometime that involves having time intervals spanning accross tens of millions of years. Such long duration time intervals have no real biological meaning since it is unlikely that all of the nodes/tips present in the time interval did ever coexisted and had ever biological interactions together.
